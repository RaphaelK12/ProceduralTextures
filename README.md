This is an experimental way to display how to make Procedural Textures using GLSL code.

1. Clone this repository locally and run a Python Simple HTTP Server

```
git clone https://github.com/tangrams/ProceduralTextures
cd ProceduralTextures
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
``` 

2. Then open your WebBrowser on the address it said, usually ```http://0.0.0.0:8000```. 

3. You will see the default fragment shader. To load a specify fragment file pass it as a hash tag. Ex: ```http://0.0.0.0:8000/#brick-05.frag```
